# What Makes a Great Git Commit Message

And why should I care?

## A Good Commit Message

> Capitalized short summary (50 chars max)
>
> More details about what your git commit accomplishes (72 chars wrap).
> In Git, this is treated as the description of your commit message. It's
> useful to provide more details than your short summary here.
>
> Something even more useful is why you made this commit. Why does your
> change fix the bug? What steps did you follow to reproduce it? What is
> useful context that can't be gleaned from your code?
>
> You can even use bullet points:
>
> - Bullet points are great
>
> - You start them with a hyphen or bullet point
>
> - Use a hanging indent
>
> It's often helpful to provide a link to JIRA or your issue tracker:
> JIRA: https://aumni.atlassian.net/browse/DEV-1234

In this sample commit message, there's A LOT of information that is included past the simple `git commit -m "Capitalized short summary"`. It has paragraphs that more explain the what, it digs into the why, and provides more context.

Can you do this with a simple `git commit -m`? No. You need to get used to `git commit`. If you're not a fan of Vim, you can swap out your Git editor: `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`.

## Why Care About Git Commit Messages

Good commit messages can:

1. Help a future reader (including yourself) understand what changed and why
2. Allow you to understand more thoroughly how a file has changed over time (ie `git blame`)
3. Make reviewing your PR easier when done commit by commit

## Rules to Follow

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
